# ExMech 

The **Self-evolving Experimental Mechanician ExMech** project aims to discover lightweight, high-strength lattice materials, combining a robotic platform for “can do” (9 workstations for standardized experimental data generation) and a multi-objective active learning framework for “can think” (guiding directional exploration through evolving structure-property understanding).

In this repository, the code required for the autonomous operation of ExMech, as well as the code for analyzing the research results, is stored. 
1.  The code for the control and communication of the robotic platform (including 9 workstations), as well as the complete pipeline and the optimization algorithm (multi-objective active learning) for the ExMech.
2.  The code for data analysis, such as the calculation of the non-dominated solution set and SHAP analysis, has also been provided along with test data.
3.  The code for parametric modeling of plate lattices, including two kinds of specimens.
